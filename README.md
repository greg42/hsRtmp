## Haskell librtmp Binding
The [librtmp](https://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/) library allows you to access RTMP 
streams without running Flash. This project aims to provide a Haskell binding
for the library, so that you can access its functionality from within Haskell
programs. For a quickstart, you might want to have a look at main.hs. Haddock 
documentation is also available.
